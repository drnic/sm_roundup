# This file is where you define any necessary functions that will be shared
# between all of your actions. You may also make map file in the root
# extension path defining a mapping of cli items to function names, example:
#
#install=myextension_install()
#

# myextension_cli()
# {
#   true # In here you implement any CLI processing
#        # arguements are passed to you in either $@ or extension_args.
# }

#
# myextension_initialize()
# {
#   true # In here you do any initialization for your extension.
# }
